          ## Monitoring


          ### EPC provides biological support from permitting to restoration and
          everything in between.


          EnviroPlus Consulting LLC has extensive experience in a wide variety
          of industries including power transmission, oil and gas exploration
          and pipelines, solar and wind projects, telecommunications, water
          projects, and commercial development. We work as part of a
          solutions-oriented team to find a path that will get the job done for
          the client. At the same time, EPC maintains outstanding relations with
          regulatory agencies whose confidence and trust is vital to the
          successful completion of a project. One way EPC achieves these
          objectives is by using only experienced professionals with a
          substantial background in their technical areas of expertise as well
          as specific experience in the particular industry of your project. You
          won’t find any recent college graduates in the field at EPC. We are
          not the cheapest consulting firm, but we do guarantee to save your
          project money in the long run with our experience.

          ## Surveys


          ### EPC has expertise with over 60 sensitive flora and fauna species.


          EPC started in 1987 with a small contract from the U.S. Bureau of Land
          Management to conduct a mark-recapture population study at a single
          desert tortoise study plot. From that humble beginning EPC has
          expanded to include an array of sensitive mammals, reptiles,
          amphibians, birds, invertebrates in addition to paleontology and
          archeology. Many listed species have specific survey protocols than
          can only be conducted by permitted biologists. EPC can conduct surveys
          for most of these species.
