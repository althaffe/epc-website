          ## Monitoring


          ### EPC provides support for industry from permitting to restoration
          and everything in between.


          EnviroPlus Consulting Inc. has extensive experience in a wide variety
          of industries including power transmission, oil and gas exploration
          and pipelines, solar and wind projects, telecommunications, water
          projects, and commercial development. We work as part of a
          solutions-oriented team to find a path that will get the job done. At
          the same time, EPC maintains outstanding relations with regulatory
          agencies whose confidence and trust is vital to the successful
          completion of a project. One way EPC achieves these objectives is by
          using only experienced professionals with a substantial background in
          their technical areas of expertise as well as specific experience in
          the particular industry of your project. You won’t find any recent
          college graduates in the field at EPC. We are not the cheapest
          consulting firm, but we do guarantee to save your project money in the
          long run with our experience.

          ## Surveys


          ### EPC has expertise with over 60 sensitive flora and fauna species.


          EPC began in 1987 when we won a contract from the U.S. Bureau of Land
          Management for mark-recapture population studies of desert tortoise.
          Through strategic collaborations with experts in a variety of fields,
          we have expanded from those humble beginnings to include an array of
          sensitive mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, invertebrates in
          addition to paleontology and archeology. Many listed species have
          specific survey protocols than can only be conducted by permitted
          biologists. EPC can conduct surveys for most of these species.
