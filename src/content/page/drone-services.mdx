seoTitle: Aerial Services Information
content:
  - body: >2
       EPC is uniquely positioned to provide aerial drone and helicopter services as both Glenn and Gilbert Goodlett are FAA licensed drone pilots. Glenn has performed over 2,810 incident-free flights while Gilbert is a licensed helicopter and fixed wing pilot with over 1,500 hours logged. EPC has comprehensive insurance for both of these operations. 

      One of the commonly requested drone services includes high resolution
      aerial imagery of construction sites. This imagery is updated
      periodically, often weekly. The imagery is a composite of thousands of
      individual photographs that is imported into GIS software where natural
      resource and engineering data is overlaid. These data can then be provided
      via a mobile and/or desktop platform so that all project personnel can
      access. Below is an example snip showing an active desert kit fox den with
      a 100-radius avoidance buffer as prescribed by permits along with live and
      dead western Joshua trees and proposed project fencelines.

          Other drone services have included capture of video and imagery of
          solar facilities for marketing and websites. 


          EPC has provided numerous helicopter services including translocation
          of over 1,000 desert tortoises at the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat
          Center and 350 tortoises from Fort Irwin associated with expansion of
          these military bases. Helicopter translocation provided a fast,
          low-impact method of moving large numbers of desert tortoises safely
          to various destinations.

          Problem – The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918 makes it
          illegal to disturb active bird nests of virtually every native bird
          species. In the desert southwest , common ravens and hawks, especially
          red-tailed hawks often nest in electrical transmission towers and
          similar elevated structures. If a utility company is building a
          transmission line next to an existing transmission line or conducting
          maintenance on an existing line, it is necessary to determine a nest
          is active.


          Solution – Currently, the primary method of determining whether a nest
          is occupied to station a biologist on the ground with a spotting
          scope. Even then the results are not always clear and can cause
          substantial delays in vital infrastructure repairs and upgrades. EPC
          has developed and tested a drone-based methodology for conclusively
          and quickly determining if a nest is occupied. The results are
          chronicled in the video on this page.

      Having found a solution to this problem, EPC is now focused on
      photogrammetry, specifically georeferenced orthophoto mosaics with
      extremely high resolutions of up to 1 cm per pixel or simply stated, high
      resolution aerial photographs with georeferencing. Applications include
      development of base layers for computer aided design project development
      planning. At lower resolutions, tracking of development at project sites
      can be cost effectively conducted by periodically re-photographing the
      project site.


      **Simultaneously, EPC is working on several additional applications
      including:**


      • By leveraging experience with high resolution photogrammetry and
      strategic partnerships, procedures will be developed for transmission and
      distribution line inspection.


      • Large area, cost effective avian mortality monitoring for solar projects
      and similar based on established line-distance sampling techniques.


      • Airborne radio tracking of wildlife species.


      • A variety of plant-related surveys.


      • And many others that have not been dreamed up yet.
