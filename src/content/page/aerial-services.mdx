      EPC is uniquely positioned to provide aerial drone and helicopter services
      as both Glenn and Gilbert Goodlett are FAA licensed drone pilots. Glenn
      has performed over 2,810 incident-free flights while Gilbert is a licensed
      helicopter and fixed wing pilot with over 1,500 hours logged. EPC has
      comprehensive insurance for both of these operations.


      One of the commonly requested drone services includes high resolution
      aerial imagery of construction sites. This imagery is updated
      periodically, often weekly. The imagery is a composite of thousands of
      individual photographs that is imported into GIS software where natural
      resource and engineering data is overlaid. These data can then be provided
      via a mobile and/or desktop platform so that all project personnel can
      access. Below is an example snip showing an active desert kit fox den with
      a 100-radius avoidance buffer as prescribed by permits along with live and
      dead western Joshua trees and proposed project fencelines.

          Other drone services have included capture of video and imagery of
          solar facilities for marketing and websites.


          EPC has provided numerous helicopter services including translocation
          of over 1,000 desert tortoises at the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat
          Center and 350 tortoises from Fort Irwin associated with expansion of
          these military bases. Helicopter translocation provided a fast,
          low-impact method of moving large numbers of desert tortoises safely
          to various destinations.

          As a part of desert tortoise translocation efforts, animals are often
          affixed with radio transmitters to aid in their location. The range of
          these transmitters is limited with a ground based observer,
          particularly if the transmitter is damaged as is often the case as a
          result of coyotes pulling out the antenna. In these cases, EPC may be
          asked to search for the missing tortoises. Using airborne radio
          tracking equipment, EPC has a stunning track record of success finding
          missing tortoises.

          Additionally, EPC has conducted several protocol golden eagle
          helicopter surveys according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
          protocols along with associated reporting.
