          ### Solar Development


          EPC has supported or is currently supporting more than a dozen
          photovoltaic development projects located in the Mojave Desert or San
          Joaquin Valley. Tasks ranged from the first biological surveys in
          support of permitting to environmental compliance during the
          Operations and Maintenance phase of the project. EPC has distinguished
          itself in the renewable energy sector in the following areas:


          * Cost effective and efficient biological survey strategies

          * Identifying potential “gotchas” in draft environmental permitting
          review

          * Finding client-centric solutions to complicated environmental
          regulation

          * “Rightsizing” staffing for solar projects with biologists
          experienced with renewable energy

          * Environmental task management to provide on-time deliverables and
          reporting

          ### ![](/2026-01-14_22.20.25.png)Delhi-Sands Flower-loving Fly
          Projects


          The Delhi-Sands Flower-loving Fly (Rhaphiomidas terminatus
          abdominalis; DSFLF) is a federally listed endangered species that has
          historically occupied approximately 40 square miles in the area of
          southern the Southern California Cities of Ontario, Colton, and
          Fontana. Its status as an endangered species has been locally
          contentious as the protection of its habitat is viewed as a hindrance
          to development. Biologists must be permitted to conduct surveys for
          DSFLF and there are less than 20 permitted biologists worldwide. Three
          of them are associated with EPC. EPC has provided a variety of
          services for clients since 1996. One of the popular services is a
          habitat suitability evaluation to help determine if focused surveys
          are required. EPC also routinely conducts protocol presence/absence
          surveys and reporting according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
          protocols.

          ### ![](/DPV2.jpg)DPV2 Transmission Line


          EPC has been providing biological support for new construction of the
          500kV Devers to Palo Verde 2 transmission project since early 2012 as
          part of a larger interdisciplinary team. At peak, EPC had 50
          biologists working on the project conducting protocol surveys and
          biological monitoring with species focus on desert tortoise, Coachella
          Valley fringe-toed lizard, flat-tailed horned lizard, Stephen’s
          kangaroo rat, and avian species. EPC was chosen to exclusively provide
          the biological monitoring support for wire stringing operations owing
          to our experience, expertise in this area.

          ### ![](/High-Desert-Power-Plant.jpg)High Desert Power Plant Gas
          Transmission Line


          Constellation Energy constructed the 830 MW gas-fired High Desert
          Power Plant near Victorville, California. The natural gas was supplied
          by a newly constructed 32-mile long pipeline interconnect to the Kern
          River Gas Transmission Line. The new line traversed occupied desert
          tortoise habitat. EPC was tasked with surveys and biological support
          for the transmission line. Intensive surveys were conducted to
          identify resources and unique strategies that focused on both
          protecting the resources and monitoring of construction activities was
          employed to achieve zero “take” of sensitive resources and
          construction of the project on schedule.

          ### ![](/2026-01-14_22.25.11.png)Western Joshua Tree Censuses and WJT
          removal


          In September of 2020, the California Fish and Game Commission advanced
          the western Joshua Tree (WJT) to state candidacy status. As an
          alternative to listing the species under the California Endangered
          Species Act, the Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act (WJTCA), a
          California State law, was enacted in July of 2023. Both the initial
          candidacy listing and the current WJTCA require a WJT census to be
          completed according to particular specifications. EPC has conducted
          multiple censused and recorded over 12,000 WJT on various solar
          projects following the protocols in place in 2020 up to the current
          WJTCA protocols. EPC utilized sub-foot accuracy location recording,
          marking of WJT with bar code readable tags, and sophisticated use of
          GIS capabilities to efficiently and accurately track WJT. EPC also
          provided biological surveys in advance of WJT removal and biological
          monitoring of WJT removal for over 11,000 WJT on projects with zero
          take of any sensitive wildlife species.
