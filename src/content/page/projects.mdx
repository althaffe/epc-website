          ### ![](/DARPA.jpg)DARPA Grand Challenge


          EPC was selected to design and implement methods to protect sensitive
          species, particularly the desert tortoise, in support of the Defense
          Advance Research Projects Agency’s Grand Challenge, an autonomous
          vehicle race in California (2004) and Nevada (2005). EPC also
          developed and presented biological and environmental training for the
          staff and competitors. Even though the driverless vehicles traversed
          terrain with many desert tortoises, no animals were injured or killed
          in either year by utilizing creative mitigation measures.

          ### ![](/Delhi-Sands.jpg)Delhi-Sands Flower-loving Fly Projects


          The Delhi-Sands Flower-loving Fly (Rhaphiomidas terminatus
          abdominalis; DSF) is a federally listed endangered species that has
          historically occupied approximately 40 square miles in the area of
          southern the Southern California Cities of Ontario, Colton, and
          Fontana. Its status as an endangered species has been locally
          contentious as the protection of its habitat is viewed as a hindrance
          to development. EPC has provided a variety of services for clients
          since 1996. These include development and use of a large scale habitat
          suitability evaluation technique, surveys according to U.S. Fish and
          Wildlife Service protocols by permitted biologists, consultation
          regarding development of roadways and power facilities, biological
          support for the development of a mitigation bank, and videography in
          support of marketing and training materials.

          ### ![](/DPV2.jpg)DPV2 Transmission Line


          EPC has been providing biological support for new construction of the
          500kV Devers to Palo Verde 2 transmission project since early 2012 as
          part of a larger interdisciplinary team. At peak, EPC had 50
          biologists working on the project conducting protocol surveys and
          biological monitoring with species focus on desert tortoise, Coachella
          Valley fringe-toed lizard, flat-tailed horned lizard, Stephen’s
          kangaroo rat, and avian species. EPC was chosen to exclusively provide
          the biological monitoring support for wire stringing operations owing
          to our experience, expertise in this area.

          ### ![](/Lake-Pleasant.jpg)Desert Tortoise Relative Density – Lake
          Pleasant, AZ


          The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) desired to determine desert
          tortoise density and distribution at the 14,000 acre Lake Pleasant
          Regional Park in order to focus recreational development in areas
          other than those suitable for desert tortoise. As an impoundment, the
          lake was surrounded by steep, rocky terrain. EPC developed and
          implemented unique strategies to achieve the BOR objectives including
          helicopter initial habitat assessments to define areas suitable for
          focused surveys, focused ground surveys using biologists with
          expertise in Sonoran desert habitat who accessed survey areas by boat,
          and an analysis technique based on standardized relative density
          methodologies.

          ### ![](/High-Desert-Power-Plant.jpg)High Desert Power Plant Gas
          Transmission Line


          Constellation Energy constructed the 830 MW gas-fired High Desert
          Power Plant near Victorville, California. The natural gas was supplied
          by a newly constructed 32-mile long pipeline interconnect to the Kern
          River Gas Transmission Line. The new line traversed occupied desert
          tortoise habitat. EPC was tasked with surveys and biological support
          for the transmission line. Intensive surveys were conducted to
          identify resources and unique strategies that focused on both
          protecting the resources and monitoring of construction activities was
          employed to achieve zero “take” of sensitive resources and
          construction of the project on schedule.
