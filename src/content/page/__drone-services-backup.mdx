          ## FAA regulations


          Currently, commercial drone operations are only permitted by the
          Federal Aviation Administration through a couple of avenues. One of
          these is to request a “Section 333 Exemption” from the FAA. EPC
          submitted its formal request to the agency on May 27, 2015. In all
          cases, FAA regulations currently require that drones (officially an
          Unmanned Aerial System or UAS) be piloted by an FAA certified pilot
          and are limited to an altitude of less than 500 ft above ground within
          visual line of sight and can be flown only during daylight hours. In
          addition to the pilot, a visual observer is required and no
          overflights of “non-participating” persons or vehicles are allowed.
          Drones are limited to a maximum gross weight 55 lbs and can be flown
          only in good weather (visual meteorological conditions in
          aviation-speak).

      ## The Machine – DJI S-1000


      The DJI Innovations S-1000 was selected by EPC as our primary workhorse
      drone owing to its reliability, versatility, and capacity. The S-1000 is a
      high performance UAS design that has thousands of safe flight hours. It is
      fully supported by DJI and there are many third party accessories
      available for the machine. As an octocopter, on board hardware and
      software can compensate for complete loss of a motor enabling a safe
      landing. The software for programming the flight controller is mature and
      sophisticated allowing for a wide range of potential missions. Like any
      good software, it is constantly being updated to add features and
      reliability. The S-1000 has a gross takeoff weight of 24 lbs enabling it
      to carry a payload of up to 11 lbs. Combined with the versatility of
      mounting options on the ship, this allows for a wide range of sensors
      and/or cameras to be carried aloft. A gyro stabilized gimbal allows for
      rock solid photos or video and independent control of the camera. The
      retractable landing gear allows for 360° pan of a camera.


      ## EPC’s Drone Team


      EPC is uniquely qualified for drone operations. Leading the drone team are
      brothers Glenn and Gilbert Goodlett. Glenn has a background in electrical
      engineering . He is also an accomplished aerobatic radio control
      helicopter builder and pilot with substantial experience in radio control
      systems. Gilbert also has a background in engineering and is an airplane
      and helicopter pilot and helicopter certified flight instructor.
      Commercial UAS operations require drones are piloted by a pilot
      certificated by the FAA. Both Glenn and Gilbert also have over 25 years
      experience as biologists in the desert southwest.


      **It is from these backgrounds that EPC has begun developing useful drone
      technologies that address real world problems. Here’s an example:**

          Problem – The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918 makes it
          illegal to disturb active bird nests of virtually every native bird
          species. In the desert southwest , common ravens and hawks, especially
          red-tailed hawks often nest in electrical transmission towers and
          similar elevated structures. If a utility company is building a
          transmission line next to an existing transmission line or conducting
          maintenance on an existing line, it is necessary to determine a nest
          is active.


          Solution – Currently, the primary method of determining whether a nest
          is occupied to station a biologist on the ground with a spotting
          scope. Even then the results are not always clear and can cause
          substantial delays in vital infrastructure repairs and upgrades. EPC
          has developed and tested a drone-based methodology for conclusively
          and quickly determining if a nest is occupied. The results are
          chronicled in the video on this page.

      Having found a solution to this problem, EPC is now focused on
      photogrammetry, specifically georeferenced orthophoto mosaics with
      extremely high resolutions of up to 1 cm per pixel or simply stated, high
      resolution aerial photographs with georeferencing. Applications include
      development of base layers for computer aided design project development
      planning. At lower resolutions, tracking of development at project sites
      can be cost effectively conducted by periodically re-photographing the
      project site.


      **Simultaneously, EPC is working on several additional applications
      including:**


      • By leveraging experience with high resolution photogrammetry and
      strategic partnerships, procedures will be developed for transmission and
      distribution line inspection.


      • Large area, cost effective avian mortality monitoring for solar projects
      and similar based on established line-distance sampling techniques.


      • Airborne radio tracking of wildlife species.


      • A variety of plant-related surveys.


      • And many others that have not been dreamed up yet.
